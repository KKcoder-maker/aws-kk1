            <h2>Our Cirtficate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
            <p>Achievements that deserve to be rewarded include many different types of victories.
          A successful international fundraiser is an achievement for the person in charge of it,
            and preparing cookies is an exemplary accomplishment for Girl Scouts. But no matter how big 
           the success, all exemplary accomplishments and achievements 
            have in common a great deal of determination, hard work, and commitment.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Awards ceremonies are also a great way to recognize people such as volunteers
                 without whom an organization would be unable to run. Volunteers' accomplishments may not
               always be "extraordinary," but their value to the organization might be such that recognition and reward
           is important. For example, the Lied Center theater at the University of Kansas holds an annual award-giving
           ceremony for its ushers. All the ushers there work on a voluntary basis and without their help, the theater performances 
          would not run as smoothly. The Lied Center feels that recognizing its volunteers is a way to show them how it appreciates their help and 
            recognizes their achievements. Although their achievements may not be mark-setting, their work is essential.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the best things in life is when an awards ceremony works; the speakers are good
     (and nobody canceled on you), the ceremony is upbeat (and never boring), and the one(s) 
     receiving the award feel really recognized (and not just fake-happy). But for everything
      to run smoothly you need to put effort into planning the ceremony. There are many details,
       and they are all important. Depending on the size and what kind of event you have in mind,
        you might want to delegate chores to a committee or to a "point person" who will recruit
         helpers. It can be dangerous to take the responsibility all on yourself,
     because the organizing of an event can become overwhelming</p>
      <br>
     <p>Ceremonies are fun, but people can get cross if there isn't anything to nibble on.
           You'll want to serve some sort of refreshments. The size of the event and the resources
           the facility offers will help determine what kind of food you'll serve. You're not going
           to serve a sit-down dinner someplace where there's no kitchen
          When considering food for your ceremony, you have two options: plan it yourself, or get 
          help from a catering service. Doing it yourself can save money, but do you have the
          manpower and expertise to put on a spread for the number of people invited? Remember, 
          you have to plan, buy, prepare and serve the food, and clean up, all of which the 
           caterers will do. On the other hand, you're paying the caterer for a pre-established
           number of people, whether they show up or not. If more show up, you're out of luck.</p>
